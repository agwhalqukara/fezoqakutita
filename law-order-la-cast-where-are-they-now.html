Although Law & Order: LA only lasted one season, it included very prominent names in TV and film.</p><p>The show, created by <strong>Dick Wolf</strong>, was the fifth Law & Order spinoff, debuting on September 29, 2010. It was the first spinoff to air after the original ended its 20-year run four months prior.</p><p>Originally titled Law & Order: Los Angeles, the procedural followed LAPD’s elite Robbery Homicide Division as they worked every angle of Los Angeles — from Beverly Hills to the seedy areas of Hollywood. The <a href=#>series was the first Law & Order show</a> that was set outside of New York City.</p><p>In addition to the main cast — <a href=#><strong>Skeet Ulrich</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Terrence Howard</strong></a>, <strong>Rachel Ticotin</strong>, <strong>Corey Stoll</strong>, <strong>Regina Hall</strong> and <strong>Alfred Molina</strong> — many other stars made cameos over time. <strong>Natalie Zea</strong>, <strong>Danielle Panabaker</strong>, <strong>Bellamy Young</strong>, <strong>Marc Blucas</strong>, <strong>Jason Beghe</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Bob Saget</strong></a> all showed up during the 22 episodes.</p><p>Many of the episodes were <a href=#>inspired by true-crime cases</a>, including the <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> infidelity scandal, <strong>John Edwards</strong>‘ political scandal, the Jihad Jane case and the Manson family murders.</p><p>In May 2011, the series was canceled by NBC.</p><p>“We tried but we didn’t have the time period to bring it back if it isn’t going to show signs of growth,” former NBC Chairman <strong>Bob Greenblatt</strong> told TVGuide at the time. “We moved it around, took it off the schedule and tried to revamp it. It improved significantly creatively, and it didn’t have a great lead-in on Mondays. It was one of those tough decisions: do we stick with it or was it time to move on?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He later told reporters, “Law & Order: LA, I think we just didn’t get it off the ground right. It was put on the schedule without a pilot last fall before I arrived. There was all kinds of chaos going on: the show did well then it was taken off. In a different scenario that might have worked better but we just thought it wasn’t a strong enough player to continue into next season.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see where the cast is today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bhrrh5zqubnqpdoa5ur8Csq2avmJq%2FpnnAq5xmrJiaxm66zrBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
