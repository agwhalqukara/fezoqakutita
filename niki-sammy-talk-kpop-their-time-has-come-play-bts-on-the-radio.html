It’s hard for Western mainstream media to accept that pop culture isn’t Americo-eurocentric. There’s this fear that playing BTS on the radio during peak hours (breakfast and drive time) will -excuse the pun- drive casual listeners away. We’ve spoken to so many media professionals and the general consensus is they feel audiences want something easy and familiar to listen to.<br></p><p><strong>Or do they?&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>K-pop is weirdly still underground in the UK and that’s part of the appeal. We get to pretend that BTS is our badly kept secret and find joy when we see them exceed in any capacity.</p><p>BTS were on Graham Norton and it was tantamount to them getting a BRIT nomination (which, btw they were robbed of.)</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>K-pop is exciting and represents some real positivity. J-hope is singlehandedly reviving red squirrels from near-extinction. Their debut gig at the O2 saw teams of volunteer litter pickers parade the grounds of the Millennium Dome collecting any and all debris that may have found itself on the ground in the queues.<br></p><p>I get that there are some practical reasons that k-pop isn’t played on UK radio as frequently – such as Korean labels not prioritizing the UK market, and therefore not making their catalog available here – but largely it’s about taking a chance.</p><p>We’ve seen Latin music getting a lot more airtime, and there was even a point a few years ago when Grime was considered “too different” to make it onto some of the biggest commercial stations… but this changed. This gives me confidence that one day, very soon, it wouldn’t be so odd to hear the Korean language on the radio.</p><p>There is a passionate, positive and supportive audience willing and <strong>ready</strong> to engage with great content. The groups, especially BTS, have positive mantras that, particularly in these uncertain times, are a happy distraction from all the negativity in the world. K-pop will follow the fans, and there are plenty of us in the UK.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ku6q3yGanpZmpYq%2B1v4yopWasmJp6s63DoqZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
