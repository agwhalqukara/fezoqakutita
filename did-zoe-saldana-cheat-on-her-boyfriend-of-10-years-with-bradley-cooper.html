The film is called The Words, and Bradley and Zoe seemed to be playing love interests… on and off the screen. There were some random tabloid reports that their romantic scenes on camera had spilled over to real life. Zoe denied those reports to <a href=#>Gossip Cop</a>, so… God knows. Anyway, the whole idea of “Who is Zoe Saldana hooking up with now?” is interesting because she allegedly has been in a relationship/engagement with Keith Britton (the dude in these photos) for TEN years. But Star Magazine is still trying to start something, using photos of Zoe’s on-again-off-again engagement ring situation to theorize that Zoe and Keith are in trouble.</p><p>By Hollywood standards, Zoe Saldana’s 10-year-relationship with fiancé businessman Keith Britton seems positively ancient. But while their love affair has yet to be characterized as on-again, off-again, the same can’t be said of Zoe’s engagement ring lately – and it’s raising some eyebrows.</p><p>On Sept. 10, Zoe was ringless as she met friends for lunch in Hollywood. Four days later, the bauble was back on as Zoe reunited with Keith, 35, to attend a birthday party for rapper Nas in NYC. But on Sept. 16, Zoe was spotted arriving solo at LAX – again, without the ring.</p><p>While a friend of Zoe and Keith tells Star “they’re fine,” there were a couple of public speebumps for the duo this past summer. They looked miserable while rushing through an appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and as Star exclusively reported, the following month, Zoe was photographed early in the morning off the Montreal set of The Words, getting touchy-feely with her costar, notorious ladies’ man Bradley Cooper – who plays her lover in the film.</p><p>[From Star Magazine, print edition]</p><p>Look, I think the Bradley Cooper situation is… odd. Some people have strong feelings about his alleged heterosexuality. Some people have strong feelings about his alleged homosexuality. The tabloids seem like they’re trying to make him the next big Hollywood stud, but I’m not sure who’s buying. So… if you were Zoe Saldana, and you were going to cheat on her boyfriend of 10 years, would you do it with Bradley Cooper? Well, Zoe might. Look at Keith! She has a type, IMO, and Bradley might fit that type.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wenn3498320.jpg alt=wenn3498320 title=wenn3498320 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wenn5616607.jpg alt=wenn5616607 title=wenn5616607 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wenn3496985.jpg alt=wenn3496985 title=wenn3496985 width=540 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Here are some photos of Zoe two nights ago, with her engagement ring definitely on:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wenn3526228.jpg alt=wenn3526228 title=wenn3526228 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wenn3526245.jpg alt=wenn3526245 title=wenn3526245 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmanBiZYN3e8Oim5iyn5qstK3LnZinmY%2BYtaat05imp5eYmr%2Bgrs6ynauhlaOxoLvFmGhpl6marrO%2FvrCgraCPl7%2BisMuesJibn6S9pr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
