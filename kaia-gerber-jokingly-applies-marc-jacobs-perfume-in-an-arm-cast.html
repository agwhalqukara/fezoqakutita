As the wind blows her hair back she goes to spritz herself with the fragrance but she can’t quite reach. She tries and tries to get closer but in the end, is unsuccessful. So, she just spritzes it in the air, walks into it and then twirls away.</p><p>“This is hard but I smell great,” she jokingly captioned the post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kaia-Gerber-Marc-Jacobs-Perfume-Spritz-Armcast-Promo.jpg><p>A-listers flooded the comments to express their love of the post, including the designer himself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marc Jacobs</strong></a>. “Even with your arm in a cast! Fantastic,” he wrote.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Patrick Schwarzenegger</strong></a> teased, “Don’t get It in your eye!!!” while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Poppy Delevigne</strong> </a>simply wrote, “Nailed it. 😍”</p><p>“Omg. I LOL’d so hard at the video,” celebrity hairstylist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Glen Coco</strong></a> wrote.</p><p>Fellow stars also noted how, even with the massive blue cast, she looks beyond incredible. “Only you can pull the cast off like this wow,” blogger <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amanda Steele</strong></a> wrote and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong></a> chimed in, “Making casts look chic.”</p><p>They’re not wrong! Even when Gerber broke the news that she had a little accident on Saturday, May 16, she looked gorgeous in an olive green <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Myra Swim bikini</a>. The following day, she used the plaster as an easy way to hold up her book while she read in the pool. Why not?!</p><p>During her Instagram Live book club chat on Sunday, the model <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained what happened</a>. “I want to talk about this week’s uninvited guest, which is my cast,” she said. “I actually broke my wrist yesterday. I was in a little bit of an accident. Thankfully I am OK, everyone is OK, and this is the worst of the injuries so I feel very grateful. And I’m not gonna let it stop me from talking about this week’s book, but it is going to be joining us for the next couple of book clubs.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Cuqq2MoJyrmpWnequ7yqKloKSpYq6xvMuinKxlnZa%2FpHnJmpqomqNivaa%2Bxa6knmWZo3qiuoyaqaZlk5bAtXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
