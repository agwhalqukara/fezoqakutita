Pannella and Stabile joined the court in 2004 and 2014, respectively.</p><p>The Superior Court is one of two statewide intermediate appellate courts and hears civil and criminal appeals from the Courts of Common Pleas.

Bender, who will retire at the end of 2023.</p><p><strong>Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania</strong></p><p>Matthew S. Wolf defeated Megan Martin for a seat on the Commonwealth Court.
