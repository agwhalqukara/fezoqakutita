Eight months after he started an online frenzy with his so-called “hot” mugshot, the convicted felon is making plans for a career in modeling and acting, despite receiving a sentence of 27 months in prison on Feb. 5.</p><p>According to <a href=#>ABC News</a>, Meeks is working with agent Jim Jordan of White Cross Management to capitalize on his Internet notoriety. Jordan told ABC there’s a “sea of opportunities waiting for him” once he’s released from the Nevada prison where he currently resides. (He’s reportedly hoping for an early release in November.)</p><p>“I’m in a place where I will be able to provide for my family and really change my life,” Meeks told ABC of his viral fame. “I never thought that everyone in the world would recognize me for my looks, so I feel extremely blessed and very thankful.”</p><p>As previously reported, Meeks was arrested in June 2014 on felony weapons charges in Stockton, Calif. After his arrest, local police posted his mugshot on Facebook, inadvertently setting in motion his unlikely ascent to stardom.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was just thinking about missing my family,” Meeks told ABC of the mugshot in question, which highlighted his pale blue eyes and chiseled jaw. “I was really thinking about my son a lot at that moment, that was the only thing that was on my mind.”</p><p>Now that he’s Internet-famous, though, he’s got a lot more to consider. He told ABC he’s interested in acting, too, and said he’s working hard to stay in shape while incarcerated. “I eat healthy,” he explained. “I do a lot of pushups, pull-ups, dips, burpees, and I stay very active.”</p><p>When he’s not working out, he keeps busy with all his fan mail. “I’ve got a lot of support [from] my family, my friends, and from my fans — I get hundreds and hundreds of letters every month,” he shared. “I’m very thankful for all the support I’ve been getting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BorF2iwqi%2Fx6irZp%2BlrnqrsdGepLJlnZqyrL%2BMqaOapp6eu6h5zKibnqSZo7Rur8CrnJ6qXZu%2FsLmMqamiq5%2BjenN8kG5rbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
