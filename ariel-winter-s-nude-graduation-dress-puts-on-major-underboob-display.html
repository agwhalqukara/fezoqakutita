A sexy black smoky eye finished off her glam.</p><p><span>Winter</span><a href=#> took to Instagram</a><span> a day after the festivities to post a pic of the dress (and her envy-inducing dessert table, which included a three-tier gold and black cake). Along with the photo, the </span><i>Sofia the First</i><span> voice actress sent a message of gratitude to her family for throwing the soiree. “Couldn't be more grateful to [my sister] @shanelle_gray & [her husband] @davidbarrygray for throwing me the most amazing graduation party ever last night…the amount of love and support they've shown me for the past four years has been life changing. My sister is my absolute best friend and my everything…❤️ Thank you so much. I couldn't be luckier or more grateful,” she wrote via </span><a href=#>Instagram</a><span>. “I was in awe last night and I still am that you guys love me that much to do all of that for me…I never would be where I am today without you two…you guys saved me and taught me to be the person I am today.”</span></p><p><span>The emotional caption didn’t stop there. The grad, who will go on to study at UCLA, thanked her father, teachers and other family members who came to support her on the special day. “So much love was felt all around last night,” she wrote. “Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!! Class of 2016…❤️ #uclabound.”</span></p><p>The ensemble from the snap was similar to the one she <a href=#>wore to her actual graduation ceremony</a>, which took place on June 13 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in L.A. On that day, she wore a bodycon nude minidress with a thigh-high slit, accessorizing with a Celine tote and nude pointed-toe pumps by Christian Louboutin. Oh, and her blue graduation cap and gown, of course, which were topped by her gold honors tassels.</p><span class=caption></span><p><i>What do you think of Ariel’s steamy graduation ensemble?</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a%2FqrHLZq6ipqSav7R5za6bnmWXp66lwcCtoKimXZm%2Fpr%2FSZqeurKNivK95zJqhqKpdqrulsdGbpqiaXZm2tLzLmrBmr2JmfXeFlmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
